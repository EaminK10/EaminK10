# Hi 👋, I'm Eamin Khan

🎓 I'm currently studying **Business Information Systems** at the **University of Westminster** and actively looking for an **industrial placement** in the **IT sector**. I'm particularly interested in roles like **Business Analyst** or **Data Analyst**.

💻 This GitHub is where I showcase my projects and the skills I’ve developed through my academic journey. These experiences have helped me build a strong foundation in tech and problem-solving skills that I’m excited to bring into the professional world.

📚 I’m currently learning **Python** and **SQL** to strengthen my data and backend knowledge.
